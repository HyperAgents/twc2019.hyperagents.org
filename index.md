<h1>Workshop on Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems</h1>

Hypermedia is increasingly being used in Web service design, particularly in Linked Data and Web of Things systems where the use of static service contracts is not practical. This evolution raises new challenges: to discover, consume, and integrate hypermedia services at runtime, clients have to become increasingly autonomous in pursuit of their design goals. Such autonomous systems have been studied to a large extent in research on multi-agent systems (MAS). To consolidate the evolution of hypermedia services, we believe it is now necessary to have comprehensive discussions on integrating hypermedia systems and MAS, henceforth hypermedia MAS. The goal of this initiative is to establish a common forum for researchers in the Web and MAS communities that will create social and technological bridges across these fields.
