<h1>Workshop on Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems</h1>

<div style="margin-top: -10px;">
	<p>In conjunction with <a href="https://www2019.thewebconf.org/">The Web Conference 2019</a> (San Francisco, May 13-14, 2019)</p>
</div>

Hypermedia is increasingly being used in Web service design, particularly in Linked Data and Web of Things systems where the use of static service contracts is not practical. This evolution raises new challenges: to discover, consume, and integrate hypermedia services at runtime, clients have to become increasingly autonomous in pursuit of their design goals. Such autonomous systems have been studied to a large extent in research on multi-agent systems (MAS). To consolidate the evolution of hypermedia services, it is now necessary to have comprehensive discussions on integrating hypermedia systems and MAS, henceforth *hypermedia MAS*.

The goal of this initiative is to establish a common forum for both the Web and MAS communities, and to create social, conceptual and technological bridges across these fields.

We invite researchers and practitioners to imagine, design, build, evaluate, and share their thoughts and visions on what the future of the Web for both people and autonomous agents will be.

We invite researchers and practitioners to imagine, design, build, evaluate, and share their thoughts and visions on what the future of the Web for both people and autonomous agents will be.

HyperAgents 2019 solicits contributions in all areas related to autonomous systems on the Web, and in particular (see complete [list of topics](/topics/) and [CFP](/HyperAgents2019_CFP.txt)):
* architectural styles and design of hypermedia MAS
* autonomous agents in hypermedia MAS
* governance in hypermedia MAS
* hybrid communities (people &amp; autonomous agents) in hypermedia MAS
* tooling &amp; applications of hypermedia MAS
* (...)

Paper submission deadline: January 11, 2019 (see all [important dates](/dates/)).
