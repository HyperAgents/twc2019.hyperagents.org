* Semantic Web, Linked Data and knowledge graphs for autonomous agents
* WoT and physical environments for autonomous agents
* De-siloization and data integration in large-scale hypermedia MAS
* Specification and enactment of interaction protocols: Web interaction protocols, interaction protocols for agents (human and non-human)
* Identification, authentication, and authorization of autonomous agents
* Large-scale search in hypermedia MAS
* Re-decentralization and distributed AI on the Web
* WebRTC &amp; peer-to-peer Web for hypermedia MAS

#### Autonomous Agents in Hypermedia MAS
* Architectures and programming languages for autonomous hypermedia agents
* Linked data programming for autonomous agents
* Context-aware agents in hypermedia MAS
* Edge AI and physical agents on the Web
* Learning in hypermedia environments
* Large-scale automated planning and distributed reasoning on the Web
* Integration of heterogeneous AI methods in hypermedia MAS
* Models and mechanisms for agent coordination

#### Governance in Hypermedia MAS
* Norm-aware agents in hypermedia MAS
* Hypermedia-based representation and advertising of norms in MAS
* Reasoning on data licensing policies, terms of services, etc.
* Privacy preservation and norm-compliant information dissemination
* Models and mechanisms for enforcing Web-scale regulation
* Trust and responsible agents
* Web-scale open organizations of autonomous agents

#### Hybrid Communities (People &amp; Autonomous Agents) in Hypermedia MAS
* Bridging formal semantics and social semantics (e.g., ontologies and folksonomies)
* Web-based collective programming, customization, and maintenance of hypermedia MAS
* Hybrid social constructs for supporting autonomous reasoning and interaction
* Human-agent interaction in hybrid communities on the Web

* Mixed reality for hypermedia MAS (e.g., interactions, monitoring, configuration)

#### Tooling &amp; Applications of Hypermedia MAS
* Programming frameworks, platforms, and other tooling for hypermedia MAS
* Hybrid communities in the Web of Things (industrial manufacturing, home and building automation, smart grids, etc.)
* Hybrid communities for enhanced social media (mitigating fake news propagation, online bullying, etc.)
* Hybrid communities for enhanced linked research (e.g., curating, sharing, and maintaining corpora and datasets)
* Hybrid communities for rewiring the Web
