In order to ensure a high-quality technical session, submissions must cover one of the proposed [workshop topics](/topics/). Authors can submit two types of papers: regular papers (max. 8 pages) and short papers (max. 4 pages) in [ACM conference format](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). All research papers must be original prior unpublished work and not under review elsewhere. Accepted papers will be published in a [CEUR](http://ceur-ws.org/) volume and on this site.

All submissions will undergo a **double-blind review process** and will be selected based on their originality, merit, and relevance to the workshop. Authors are therefore expected to **remove any connection to their identity** from their papers. Submission requires at least one author to present the paper on-site. If you can, we encourage authors of accepted papers to bring a prototype and demonstrate it at the workshop.

Please submit papers through EasyChair: [http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hyperagents2019](http://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=hyperagents2019)
