CALL FOR PAPERS - Workshop on Hypermedia Multi-Agent Systems (HyperAgents 2019)
in conjunction with The Web Conference 2019, San Francisco, California, USA, May 13-17, 2019.
http://www.hyperagents.org/


-- Workshop Abstract

Hypermedia is increasingly being used in Web service design, particularly in Linked Data and Web of Things systems where the use of static service contracts is not practical. This evolution raises new challenges: to discover, consume, and integrate hypermedia services at runtime, clients have to become increasingly autonomous in pursuit of their design goals. Such autonomous systems have been studied to a large extent in research on multi-agent systems (MAS). To consolidate the evolution of hypermedia services, it is now necessary to have comprehensive discussions on integrating hypermedia systems and MAS, henceforth hypermedia MAS.

The goal of this initiative is to establish a common forum for both the Web and MAS communities, and to create social, conceptual and technological bridges across these fields.

-- Contributing to HyperAgents 2019

HyperAgents 2019 solicits contributions in all areas related to Web-based MAS. We invite researchers and practitioners to imagine, design, build, evaluate, and share their thoughts and visions on what the future of the Web for both people and autonomous agents will be.

- Architectural Styles and Design of Hypermedia MAS
-- Design principles, models, and architectures for hypermedia MAS
-- Semantic Web, Linked Data and knowledge graphs for autonomous agents
-- WoT and physical environments for autonomous agents
-- De-siloization and data integration in large-scale hypermedia MAS
-- Specification and enactment of interaction protocols: Web interaction protocols, interaction protocols for agents (human and non-human)
-- Identification, authentication, and authorization of autonomous agents
-- Large-scale search in hypermedia MAS
-- Re-decentralization and distributed AI on the Web
-- WebRTC & peer-to-peer Web for hypermedia MAS

- Autonomous Agents in Hypermedia MAS
-- Architectures and programming languages for autonomous hypermedia agents
-- Linked data programming for autonomous agents
-- Context-aware agents in hypermedia MAS
-- Edge AI and physical agents on the Web
-- Learning in hypermedia environments
-- Large-scale automated planning and distributed reasoning on the Web
-- Integration of heterogeneous AI methods in hypermedia MAS
-- Models and mechanisms for agent coordination

- Governance in Hypermedia MAS
-- Norm-aware agents in hypermedia MAS
-- Hypermedia-based representation and advertising of norms in MAS
-- Reasoning on data licensing policies, terms of services, etc.
-- Privacy preservation and norm-compliant information dissemination
-- Models and mechanisms for enforcing Web-scale regulation
-- Trust and responsible agents
-- Web-scale open organizations of autonomous agents

- Hybrid Communities (People & Autonomous Agents) in Hypermedia MAS
-- Bridging formal semantics and social semantics (e.g., ontologies and folksonomies)
-- Web-based collective programming, customization, and maintenance of hypermedia MAS
-- Hybrid social constructs for supporting autonomous reasoning and interaction
-- Human-agent interaction in hybrid communities on the Web
-- Collective interaction models and agreement in hybrid communities
-- Mixed reality for hypermedia MAS (e.g., interactions, monitoring, configuration)

- Tooling & Applications of Hypermedia MAS
-- Programming frameworks, platforms, and other tooling for hypermedia MAS
-- Hybrid communities in the Web of Things (industrial manufacturing, home and building automation, smart grids, etc.)
-- Hybrid communities for enhanced social media (mitigating fake news propagation, online bullying, etc.)
-- Hybrid communities for enhanced linked research (e.g., curating, sharing, and maintaining corpora and datasets)
-- Hybrid communities for rewiring the Web

The workshop will provide an interactive forum for Web and MAS researchers to learn about and discuss existing efforts related to Web-based MAS. In order to ensure a high-quality technical session, submissions must cover one of the topics above and can be either regular papers (max. 8 pages) or short papers (max. 4 pages) in ACM conference format. Research papers must be original prior unpublished work and not under review elsewhere as they will be published to the ACM digital library and listed on DBLP. All submissions will be peer-reviewed and selected based on their originality, merit, and relevance to the workshop. Submission requires at least one author to present the paper on-site. If you can, we encourage authors of accepted papers to bring a prototype and demonstrate it at the workshop.
